## TODO
* []Redesign convolution through #pragma HLS dataflow that make the circle detection A LOT faster than current filters.
* []Acces DMA through PetaLinux userspace
* [x]Implement CircleFilter design into HW, with Vivado & PetaLinux.

## FINISHED
* [x]HLS_SimpleDesign converts an input image through an AXI stream port with HLS dataflow and returns it as an AXI stream. (This is mainly used as a 'playground' to experiment the HLS flow.)
